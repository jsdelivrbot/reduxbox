# ReduxBox

Getting hands dirty with [Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/). Please be kind and don't _laugh_

### What is a reducer?
Don't worry, me too I was wondering about it for a long time.
> So a **REDUCER** is a function that return a piece of the application state


### Okay, what about Redux itself?
Well according to their amazing website, this is what [**REDUX**](http://redux.js.org/) is all about:
> Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. (If you're looking for a WordPress framework, check out Redux Framework.)

> It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.
